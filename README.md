# Compsig

`compsig` is a tool for converting signal between languages for music
composition and audio synthesis (e.g.,
[supercollider](https://supercollider.github.io)).  This repository
contains an experiment/proof of concept, i.e., it's incredibly rough.

Compsig is written in [OCaml](https://ocaml.org) by [William
Chen](https://github.com/chenxww) and [Nathan
Mull](https://nmmull.github.io) as a part of a
[UROP](https://www.bu.edu/urop/) project funded by Boston University.

## Usage

Currently, the only way to use `compsig` is to build it from the
source.  You can clone this program and build an executable using
`dune build`.
